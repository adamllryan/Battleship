# Battleship
Quick two class battleship console game I made for our MATLAB game project in ENGR1181 at tOSU
Probably could be more efficient, but I wrote this very late at night right before finals so I wasn't exactly
thinking clearly. It works, though. 

Has a game functions class file and a game controller file to allow modified game modes, did not make sure 
that class methods will work in any other configuration, though.
